# Butlerian Jihad ðŸ¤–

### Data protocol for authentificating real human creation, connected to a DataDAO for private model training.

## Introduction

The Butlerian Jihad is the term used for the crusades against the machines - AI - in the Dune universe. We've been bombed from AI Generated content in the past years, and it looks like there are only two solutions against that : 
- you either consider the content before Gen AI the only one worth something.
- or you try to give artists a way to create fair models based on their works.

All of those solutions have the same shortcomings : you can just right-click download.
Butlerian Jihad is a fair protocol, enabling Instagram artists to prove ownership of their account, create / join a DataDAO based on their reputation and partner with other fair artists to train models or LoRA.

## Features

- TLS Notary extension focused on Instagram account retrieval.
- Boilerplate for TLS Notary extension
- Onchain smart contract for DataDAO set-up.
- DataDAO for private model training.

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/butlerianjihad/butlerian_jihad.git
cd butlerian_jihad
npm install
npm run dev
```

Add your Lighthouse API key by copying the .env.example.

Build the Instagram plugin on tlsn-plugin-instagram:

```sh
npm i
npm run build
```

This will output the wasm binary in `dist/index.wasm`.
You can also directly use the one available.

### Running the Instagram Plugin Example

1. Build the `instagram_profile` plugin as explained above.
2. Build and install the `tlsn-extension` as documented in the [main README.md](../README.md).
3. [Run a local notary server](https://github.com/tlsnotary/tlsn/blob/main/notary-server/README.md), ensuring `TLS` is disabled in the [config file](https://github.com/tlsnotary/tlsn/blob/main/notary-server/config/config.yaml#L18).
4. Install the plugin: Click the **Add a Plugin (+)** button and select the `index.wasm` file you built in step 1. A **Instagram Profile** button should then appear below the default buttons.
5. Click the **Instagram Profile** button. This action opens the Instagram webpage along with a TLSNotary sidebar.
6. Run your own Instagram proxy - [Follow this tutorial](https://docs.tlsnotary.org/quick_start/tlsn-js.html?highlight=proxy#run-a-local-notary-server-and-websocket-proxy--optional) and run : docker run -it --rm -p 55688:80 novnc/websockify 80 instagram.com:443
8. Follow the steps in the TLSNotary sidebar.
9. Access the TLSNotary results by clicking the **History** button in the TLSNotary extension.
